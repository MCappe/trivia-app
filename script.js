// Pseudo Code
// Upon loading, user is shown an animation about playing a trivia game with 3 options to choose subjects (Entertainment, General, Fun Facts)
  // Each subject will have 10-15 random questions pre-loaded in an array of objects
// Once the user selects their subject, a timer will count down 5 seconds until first question appears
// Each question will have a 10 second timer
// They will have 10 questions to answer and they will always know what question they are on because of a tally at the bottom of the question box (question 1 of 10, for example)
// Each question will be a button
// If the answer is correct, a message below the answers will display, CORRECT, if incorrect, it will say INCORRECT and will hover over the correct answer.
// After an answer is selected, whether correct or incorrect, the user will be shown a button to go to the next question
// Once all questions are answered, they user will be shown a tally of the ones they got correct and incorrect 
// The user will be given the option to play again, which will bring them back to the original screen with the subject options
  // subject options will also be available in the top header nav, so they can interrupt their current game to go to another subject if they choose (but will get an alert asking if they'd like to end the current game)

// Questions for Entertainment
